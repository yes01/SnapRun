/// One-time migration from the shared Application Support root to a bundleID-
/// namespaced subdirectory.
///
/// Background: pre-v1.4.2 builds wrote `default.store` (release) or
/// `snaprun-dev.store` (dev) directly into `~/Library/Application Support/`.
/// Apple explicitly warns against this:
///
/// > Two or more apps that use the default location and name will either
/// > overwrite each other's models, or crash because the model on disk doesn't
/// > match the model described in the app.
///
/// `default.store` is the SwiftData convention any other unsandboxed SwiftData
/// app defaults to. When such an app runs, macOS 15's persistent-history logic
/// sees TaskTick's entities as "removed" and truncates the tables — the silent
/// data-loss failure mode in issue #22 (`dfface` report).
///
/// This migration moves the store into a per-bundleID subdirectory so no other
/// app can ever touch it.
///
/// **Safety invariants** (re-read these before changing anything):
///
/// 1. **Never delete the legacy files.** They stay as a permanent safety net.
///    Worst case the user can manually swap them back in.
/// 2. **Copy-to-tmp-then-rename.** Every file is copied to `<name>.migrating`
///    first; the atomic rename to the final name only happens after ALL tmp
///    copies succeed.
/// 3. **Rename order: `-wal` → `-shm` → `.store`.** SwiftData decides "the
///    store exists" by checking the main `.store` file. If we renamed `.store`
///    first and crashed, the next launch would see "migrated" but the
///    companion files would still be `.migrating` — SQLite would open a
///    partially-configured store. Keeping `.store` last guarantees that as
///    soon as it exists at the final name, its companions already do too.
/// 4. **Size sanity-check after every copy.** A short write on a full disk
///    would corrupt the new store. Size mismatch ⇒ rollback, leave legacy
///    alone, return the (still-empty) new URL so SwiftData triggers recovery.
/// 5. **Ambiguous states fail safe.** If both legacy and new already have data,
///    use new (don't auto-merge). The operator can recover either manually.
/// 6. **Never throw.** Migration runs inside a `static let` initializer; a
///    throw there would crash the app on launch. Any failure is logged and
///    the caller falls back to opening the (possibly empty) new path.
